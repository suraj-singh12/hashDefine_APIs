1) collect data in json files
  a. 1 json file for each type of data (like for clothes -> clothes.json, for keyboards -> keyboards.json)
2) make a mongodb database locally
3) make collections with the json file names; and store data in respective collections
4) make an empty repo, and push it on github, everything we do in this repo from now,
   do `npm init` in current folder, install packages mentioned in my `package.json` using `npm i package_name` , 
   create a .gitignore same as here, create an api document,  
   now make app.js and make routes using express to make APIs
5) create .env file and put PORT, MongoURL, MongoLiveUrl(will fill value later in this one) there
   write all code to make the apis as here we have (i.e. all files as in this dir structure (except this).
6) then run the apis locally using `npm run dev`
   and test each one of them using postman

7) when the apis are running locally perfectly then -> 
8) go to mongodb website, sign in, create a cluster (free one) if you don't have a cluster
9) and then setup ip as 0.0.0.0/0 and username: alpha, password: alpha123  (don't use any special char in password, it creates problems in connecting using code later on)
10) go to dashboard and create a database (same as that on your local mongodb database)
11) create same collections, and add data to them in same way as done in local db
12) after this done, go to dashboard, and click connect > connect my application; copy the url, and paste in .env file as value of MongoLiveUrl
13) change the <password> in the url you pasted to alpha123 (as we had set earlier)
14) go to app.js and change the mongoUrl value to process.env.MongoLiveUrl
15) if you have a different name of database (that we created in step 10) than the local one, then change database name in app.js
    in the line db = client.db(yourDatabase) to the one in your cloud database (mongodb website one)
16) now run the apis again, and ensure they are working perfectly
    test them well using postman

17) if all working fine, then ensure you pushed your all code to github using commands
`git add .`      `git commit -m 'your message'`         `git push origin main`
18) go to heroku and sign in,
19) create a new app, give any name and create. Go to deploy > click on `Connect to Github` > then search for your repo (in which we did all work and pushed on github)
20) connect that repo, click main branch, and hit `deploy branch`.
21) after this go to settings and click `reveal config vars` 
22) add your .env file variables with their values (exactly same names/values as in env file)
23) then go to deploy, and hit `deploy branch` button 
24) app will get deployed, you will get a message like : 'Your app was successfully deployed.'
25) click `View` below it to reach to see. If page loads successfully and is as expected, then your app is working fine.
26) the part http://localhost:port_no   will get replaced by   https://your_app_name.herokuapp.com  in live api when you use
27) now test your live api using postman and ensure it's working fine !
28) you are done then! Good Job! 

NOTE: Now every-time you make any change to your `app.js`, you need to go to heroku, sign in and go to your app, and deploy the main branch again.
if you make any change to your .env file, you need to add/remove the same in `config vars` in settings of your heroku app.
